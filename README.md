# ASA-Formalization

An attempt at creating a computational formalization for the Attraction-Selection-Attrition Model of Organizational Behavior.

The ASA Model (broadly) predicts that people will flock to organizations similar to them and depart when their organization is dissimilar to them (this is a simplification, see Schneider's work for the actual information on this)

My problem with the ASA Model is a instantiation of my issues with verbal theories broadly in that the claims are vague and make unclear what actually will happen in the long run if people behave in this way.

Here I attempt to convert the ASA model into an ABM.
